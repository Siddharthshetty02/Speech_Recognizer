# Speech_Recognizer

## Overview
This project is a Python-based Speech Recognition System that converts voice input into text and processes predefined commands. It can provide responses, perform actions like telling the time, and execute tasks based on voice commands.

## Features
Converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition API.
Executes predefined commands such as:
Greeting the user.
Telling the current time.
Exiting the program.
Provides text-to-speech responses using the pyttsx3 library.

## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
speech_recognition: For recognizing speech.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
pyaudio: For capturing audio input.

## Usage
The system will listen for your commands and respond accordingly.
Examples of supported commands:
Say "hello" to receive a greeting.
Ask "What time is it?" to get the current time.
Say "exit" or "quit" to terminate the program.

## Future Enhancements
Add support for more complex commands.
Integrate with external APIs (e.g., weather updates, news).
Develop a GUI for a better user experience.
Enable control of system operations or smart devices.

## Troubleshooting
Ensure your microphone is working correctly.
If the program fails to recognize speech, check your internet connection (required for Google API).
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
